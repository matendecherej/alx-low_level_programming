Sure, here's an example of a README.md file for the 0x12. C - Singly linked lists project:

# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

## Description
This project is an introduction to singly linked lists in C programming language. It includes various tasks that involve creating, manipulating, and traversing singly linked lists.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- gcc 4.8.4

## Tasks

### 0. Print list
Write a function `print_list` that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.

### 1. List length
Write a function `list_len` that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.

### 2. Add node
Write a function `add_node` that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.

### 3. Add node at the end
Write a function `add_node_end` that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.

### 4. Free list
Write a function `free_list` that frees a `list_t` list.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the C files with the command `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <output_file>` where `<output_file>` is the name of the output file.
4. Run the executable with the command `./<output_file>`.
