# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops #

## Description ##

### Functions are self-contained blocks of code that can be called from other parts of the program. They are used to perform a specific task and can accept parameters and return values. Nested loops are loops that are placed inside other loops. They are used to iterate over multiple sets of data and can be used to perform complex operations. ###
