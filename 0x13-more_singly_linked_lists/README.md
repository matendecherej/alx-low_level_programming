# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

This project covers the topic of singly linked lists in C programming language. It builds on the previous project on singly linked lists and introduces new concepts such as linked list manipulation, memory allocation, and recursion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept of a singly linked list
- Be able to manipulate singly linked lists
- Understand how to allocate and free memory dynamically
- Be able to write recursive functions

## Requirements

- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are allowed to use the standard library.

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each of which is designed to help you practice working with singly linked lists. Some of the tasks include:

- **0. Print list:** A function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.
- **1. List length:** A function that returns the number of elements in a `listint_t` list.
- **2. Add node:** A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list.
- **3. Add node at the end:** A function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list.
- **4. Free list:** A function that frees a `listint_t` list.
- **5. Free:** A function that frees a `listint_t` list and sets the head to NULL.
- **6. Pop:** A function that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` list and returns the head node's data.
- **7. Get node at index:** A function that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` list.
- **8. Sum list:** A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `listint_t` list.
- **9. Insert:** A function that inserts a new node at a given position in a `listint_t` list.
- **10. Delete at index:** A function that deletes the node at a given position in a `listint_t` list.
- **11. Reverse list:** A function that reverses a `listint_t` list.
- **12. Print (safe version):** A function that prints a `listint_t` list and returns the number of nodes in the list.
- **13. Free (safe version):** A function that frees a `listint_t` list and sets the head to NULL.
